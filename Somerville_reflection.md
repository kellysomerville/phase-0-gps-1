* I am doing this SOLO because my LAME ass did not set the Appointment time correct in my alarm !!!  **IDIOT**

1. Prior to GPS the whole moving between branches and back and forth remote/local was a bit "AHHHHHHHH" As well as the general git commands to use

2. I clarified.... for myself haow to add files in differnt branches and moving back and forth between branches

3. Well since I was rolling SOLO i asked myself a million questions.  and refered to my notes on the branch video from last week.  that video saved my life today !! so glad i'm OCD with notes !!

4. Solving conflicts when I put a file in the wrong area or adding way to many directories or subdirectories is a thing that I was doing.  I finally figured it out...well for now. I was adding new directories when I should have just opened the current one...resulting in a million sub-directories.  

5.  My 1st GPS pairing.... WAS HORRIBLE because I missed my time and had a panick attack.  But then I sucked it up and sat down at my computer and said.."get over yourself kelly it's time to handle this assignment !!!!!"
